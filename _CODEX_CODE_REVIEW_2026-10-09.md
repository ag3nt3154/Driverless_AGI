# Dagi code review — 2026-10-09

## Scope and priorities

Reviewed **main** at **94ca6924880867924ca6a90b7d0ca510e8b601a6**, starting from a clean checkout.
Code mode and CLI UTF-8 output are the application changes since the previous run; the
scheduler, Telegram, child cleanup, plan parser and benchmark outcome paths are unchanged.
The October 8 reports were edited in place and renamed to October 9. This report contains
**14 open findings only**, retaining stable IDs.

Prioritize execution ownership and truthful outcomes (R4/R10/R16/R18), Telegram delivery
and answer routing (R11/R12), then publication, plan assignment and retained diagnostics
(R14/R15/R17/R19). R18/R19 are newly reproduced. Existing findings were rechecked against
current source; prior runtime evidence is dated explicitly rather than presented as a new run.

## R3 — P2: Record scheduler startup failures

**Finding:** Initialization sits outside the per-task error boundary.

**Issue:** [Startup](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/scheduler/runner.py:93) constructs the
tracker and loop after a config-only exception handler. October 8's injected loop constructor
failure escaped with zero recorded attempts. The due-task loop has no outer per-job boundary,
so later jobs are interrupted. Tracker construction and finish can also escape by inspection.

**Suggested solution:** Include config, tracker, callbacks and loop construction in one
per-task boundary. Record failed attempts and continue later jobs. Isolate cleanup failures
so they cannot overwrite the original diagnostic. Exercise construction and finish failures
through the real scheduler with fake execution.

## R4 — P1: Confirm execution stopped before finalizing

**Finding:** A scheduler timeout ends the wait while owned execution remains active.

**Issue:** [Timeout handling](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/scheduler/runner.py:111) joins a
daemon thread, calls finish, then checks liveness. The October 8 controlled-worker probe reproduced
finish while live and a timeout record. The probe released and waited for its worker afterward.
Real task tools can continue writing after finalization or during a later task.

**Suggested solution:** Own unattended execution in a process and confirm bounded termination
of descendants before finalizing or starting another job. Reuse existing process-tree support
where appropriate. Retain partial evidence and report failure to stop explicitly. Test blocked
providers, long tools and descendants; a thread join timeout cannot enforce a deadline.

## R7 — P2: Reduce remaining orchestration complexity behind supported seams

**Finding:** Several production modules and callback builders exceed the project's size limits.

**Issue:** AST inventory of 226 tracked Python files in agent/tools/scheduler/tg/tui/
pyside_gui/providers/services and root entry points found five above 500 lines:
agent/loop.py (1,082), tools/subagent_main.py (744), tools/read/_reader_controller.py (525),
pyside_gui/app.py (518) and pyside_gui/prompt_input.py (628). Three functions exceed 100:
config_loader._build_config_from_entry (106), PySide bridge.build_callbacks (107), and TUI
callbacks.build_callbacks (178). Counts include comments/docstrings; this inventory uses a
broader explicit file set than the previous run, so totals are not a growth measurement.
Size alone is not a bug; adapter defects show where lifecycle contracts are missing.
Cyclomatic complexity was not measured.

**Suggested solution:** Define explicit run outcomes and stop/wait semantics with one state
owner before further extraction. Reduce large files along supported public API boundaries.
Preserve registration, construction, dispatch and child argv ordering tests. Avoid splitting
files solely to improve counts.

## R8 — P2 residual: Release abandoned child metadata

**Finding:** Public child identity can outlive confirmed force-kill or parent closure.

**Issue:** [_pending_children](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/tools/subagent_api.py:62) retains
the fork and parent provider until terminal resume or PID overwrite. The runner's
[force-kill cleanup](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/tools/_subagent_runner.py:227) clears its
own tracking without releasing this public metadata. A child never resumed can therefore
retain parent references. This is source-inspected ownership debt; retained heap growth was
not measured. The scope here is abandoned metadata, not stale-result acceptance.

**Suggested solution:** Tie public identity to an owned handle that releases metadata on
confirmed exit, force-kill and parent closure without requiring another resume. Preserve
branch/generation validation. Add cleanup tests for abandoned children and reused PIDs;
elapsed waiting alone must not imply confirmed exit.

## R10 — P1: Propagate terminal failure into scheduler and benchmark results

**Finding:** Both adapters classify a normally returned terminal error as successful execution.

**Issue:** [Scheduler execution](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/scheduler/runner.py:102)
selects success from liveness and Python exceptions. The October 8 real-loop probe with mocked null responses
ended with TURN_END error, while the scheduler recorded success and an empty summary.
The [benchmark path](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/benchmarks/dagi_eval/harness.py:171)
likewise returned stats.error=None and timed_out=False for a real loop terminal error.
Artifact correctness scoring is separate; score inflation was not tested.

**Suggested solution:** Expose a typed outcome with terminal reason, final text, diagnostics
and artifacts, then require both adapters to consume it. Distinguish completion, failure,
exhaustion and cancellation; report artifact acceptance separately. Cover null exhaustion,
continuation limits, handoff and exceptions without classifying text prefixes.

## R11 — P1: Deliver Telegram's final handoff

**Finding:** A tool-only completed handoff produces no Telegram message.

**Issue:** [Callbacks](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/tg/callbacks.py:88) discard on_done and
tool results. October 8's real loop with these callbacks, fake bot and mocked provider returned
FINAL REPORT with zero send_message calls. The defect is reproduced without Telegram traffic.

**Suggested solution:** Deliver the final outcome and track already delivered text to avoid
duplicates within a known attempt. Retain the result when sending fails. Test tool-only and
text-only completion plus delivery failure. Keep uncertain remote delivery status explicit.

## R12 — P1: Keep Telegram answer dispatch available

**Finding:** A task handler waiting for an answer blocks dispatch of the answer itself.

**Issue:** [Application setup](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/tg/bot.py:58) uses sequential
PTB dispatch; [the handler](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/tg/bot.py:143) awaits the executor
job. In the October 8 probe through the local PTB update fetcher, a synthetic answer was dispatched only after
the waiting handler was released. Concurrency=1 and a blocking handler were confirmed.
No network calls occurred.

**Suggested solution:** Own per-chat background tasks while leaving dispatch available.
Preserve per-session start guards. Register pending questions before sending, and clear
them in finally. Test answers, two chats, repeated messages, clear, late answers and shutdown
through real dispatch with mocked delivery.

## R13 — P2: Release Telegram busy state on every exit

**Finding:** Failure of optional typing notification leaves the session permanently busy.

**Issue:** [_run_agent_task](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/tg/bot.py:150) sets busy and awaits
typing before entering try/finally. The October 8 typing-exception probe left busy=true; current ordering is unchanged. Finish
also precedes the busy reset by source inspection; finish failure was not separately injected.

**Suggested solution:** Cover the full acquired lifetime with outer try/finally and reset
busy even if finalization fails. Treat typing as optional diagnostics, clear pending questions,
and preserve original error context. Test typing, finish and cancellation failures.

## R14 — P2: Include output publication in the scheduler outcome

**Finding:** The scheduler records success before delivering the configured output file.

**Issue:** [record_run](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/scheduler/runner.py:127) precedes
[publication](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/scheduler/runner.py:129). The October 8 fake successful loop
with an existing directory as output_file produced a success record followed by an
uncaught PermissionError. No requested file was published. Interval advancement and later-job
interruption follow this ordering; no external scheduled task was run.

**Suggested solution:** Separate computation from required delivery, retain the result and
record final status after publication. Use temporary-file replacement where feasible. Expose
export retry with a corrected destination without rerunning tools. Keep later jobs runnable.
Test unwritable destinations, replace failure and successful publication with real temp files.

## R15 — P2: Restore verification of the current plan format

**Finding:** Plan-format tests still target an intentionally removed template.

**Issue:** Three [contract tests](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/tests/test_workflow_plan_template.py:15)
again fail with FileNotFoundError for .dagi/skills/write-plan/references/plan-template.md.
The [inline writer format](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/.dagi/skills/write-plan/SKILL.md:48)
omits status markers; the parser reports unmarked headings as unknown. The writer/parser
contract is inconsistent. No live generated plan or delivery run was tested.

**Suggested solution:** Validate current inline skill examples or a small repository-owned
format fixture, rather than the deleted template or a personal global skill. Specify marker
rules consistently. Exercise constraints, subtask isolation, assignment and marker round-trip.
Do not restore removed content merely to satisfy stale tests.

## R16 — P1: Claim scheduled work before execution

**Finding:** Independent scheduler launches can execute the same due task concurrently.

**Issue:** [main](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/scheduler/runner.py:146) reads due times into
each process and starts work without a claim or lock. [RunTracker](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/scheduler/tracker.py:38)
knows only completed attempts. On October 8, two actual Python processes invoking the real scheduler against
one temporary history both entered the same task before either finished, then wrote two success
records. Provider execution was replaced with a controlled fake loop; the race is in scheduler
admission. A later launch during a long task can duplicate tools and workspace changes. The
batch launcher describes frequent invocation as harmless without specifying an overlap guard.

**Suggested solution:** For the current sequential design, acquire a process-scoped lock for
the schedule before loading due state; re-read history after admission and release only after
owned execution stops. Reject overlapping launches explicitly. If per-task concurrency is later
needed, use durable attempt identity and atomic claims, with recovery that verifies the previous
owner stopped. Add a two-process regression plus killed-owner recovery. A thread lock or a
finished-only JSONL record cannot coordinate independent launches.

## R17 — P2: Select the exact requested plan subtask

**Finding:** Worker assignment silently picks an earlier task whose title contains the request.

**Issue:** [extract_subtask](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/tools/_plan_parser.py:111) returns
the first case-insensitive substring match in any level-three heading. The real
[worker composer](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/.dagi/subagents/worker/plan_utils.py:37),
given Subtask 1: Validate input and Subtask 2: Validate, assigned the first task's body/tests
when asked for Validate on October 8. Today's direct parser probe again selected the
wrong block. The requested second task's content was absent. Existing tests allow
partial-name lookup but do not protect an exact match later in the plan. No model call is needed
to reproduce incorrect delegation.

**Suggested solution:** Parse numbered task headings and prefer an exact normalized task name
or stable task number. If partial-name lookup remains supported, allow only a unique match and
report ambiguity. Reject duplicate identities or missing matches before delegation. Test exact
names that are substrings of earlier titles, ambiguous fragments and unrelated level-three headings.

## R18 — P1: Give code-mode execution one cancellation and deadline owner

**Finding:** Killing the script does not reliably prevent parent-side tool execution.

**Issue:** [_serve](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/tools/code/_code.py:192) runs each
proxied call synchronously in the parent and checks its deadline only when waiting for an
RPC line. A real nested bash sleeping two seconds kept a one-second code call alive for
2.18 seconds. This overrun is documented in the design, but the execution budget remains
unenforced during nested tools. More seriously,
[force_kill](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/tools/code/_code.py:157)
sets a flag and kills only the runner tree; the flag is not checked before dispatching a
selected call. A controlled gate between RPC selection and actual dispatch demonstrated
a real temporary-file write after force_kill returned true, followed by a killed result.
AgentLoop separately kills bash before code, leaving a similar start-versus-stop race.
This probe controls the interleaving; it does not measure how often users encounter it.

**Suggested solution:** Coordinate cancellation with admission of each nested call. Reject
new dispatch after stop is requested, propagate the remaining budget to nested bash, and
track/stop the active parent-owned operation before reporting stopped. Support cooperative
stop for file tools or own non-cooperative execution in a terminable process. A runner-tree
kill alone cannot stop work executing in the parent. Add gated cancellation and long nested
tool tests alongside the existing idle-script timeout/kill tests.

## R19 — P2: Retain code-mode output before abnormal termination

**Finding:** Script progress is held only in child memory until normal completion.

**Issue:** [Capture](C:/Users/alexr/Driverless_AGI/tools/code/_runner.py:108) replaces
stdout/stderr with StringIO and sends their contents only in the final done message. Real
scripts printed a flushed checkpoint before an infinite loop or sleep. Timeout and force-kill
both returned [no output], losing that checkpoint. The mutation ledger survives in the parent,
but printed observations and diagnostics do not. The existing exception test passes because
caught script exceptions still send done; it does not cover process termination. Capture
is also unbounded before the outer result filter, by inspection; memory growth was not tested.

**Suggested solution:** Stream output frames over the existing RPC channel or spool them to
a parent-owned per-attempt artifact. Retain a bounded tail and a full artifact reference on
timeout, kill and crash; apply size limits while capturing, before final formatting. Preserve
ordering with tool replies and avoid replaying mutations to recover lost output. Add real
print-then-timeout/kill/crash fixtures and a bounded-output check.

## Verification and limits

- Focused suite: **155 passed, 3 failed in 9.46s**, using the dagi interpreter outside the
  Windows sandbox. Covers code runner/tool, registry ordering, interrupt, bash, config,
  CLI encoding and plan parsing/format. All failures are R15's missing-template tests.
- First attempt: 158 setup errors from sandbox temp-directory permissions. With explicit
  writable basetemp: 152 passed, 6 failed; the interpreter warning and two process-kill
  timing failures disappeared outside the sandbox. These are not counted as dagi findings.
- New offline probes reproduced R18's nested deadline and cancellation interleaving, plus
  R19's output loss, both inside and outside the sandbox. R17 direct parsing remains wrong.
  Controlled threads were released/joined; subprocesses were reaped; writes used temporary
  workspaces. A forced-kill pipe finalizer emitted an ignored OSError; no cleanup repair was
  attempted. Assertions reproduce defects rather than validate proposed fixes.
- Earlier R3/R4/R10–R14/R16 adapter/process reproductions are retained as **October 8**
  evidence. Their owning source files are unchanged. They were not rerun today. R8 remains
  source-inspected cleanup debt. No resolved finding was reopened without contrary evidence.
- [Today's probe source](C:/Users/alexr/.codex/visualizations/2026/10/09/01a12093-68e8-7b40-98a4-9682ae3fc5c0/review_probes.py)
  and [results](C:/Users/alexr/.codex/visualizations/2026/10/09/01a12093-68e8-7b40-98a4-9682ae3fc5c0/review_probe_results.json)
  retain the reproductions/inventory. [Prior probes](C:/Users/alexr/.codex/visualizations/2026/10/08/01a11b73-16a4-7810-b1e8-4e890c34d652/)
  retain unchanged-path evidence. Python: C:/Users/alexr/miniconda3/envs/dagi/python.exe -u;
  pytest-qt/cache disabled. Test commands are retained in today's refresh script.
- No full/GUI/live-provider/Telegram/campaign/converter/power-loss suite. Actual script and
  nested shell execution were tested; descendant containment under failed termination was
  not. Review is documentation-only: no application repairs or Git mutations.
